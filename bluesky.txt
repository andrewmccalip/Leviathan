自分の苦しみ全部言えたのここまでの生涯でたった一人だけなんだけどなんで言えたんだろ。言えた理由が分かったらまた誰かと同じように心許せるようになるのかな

言えてからの時間は楽しくもあり嬉しい時間だっただけにその子だけは、俺が幸せにしてあげられなくてごめんねって今でも思う。その子が居なかったら苦しみに押し潰されて多分本当に命断ってたと思う。

今は死にたくなってもその時を超えると思えないから彼女はたった一人の嘘偽りなく心からそうだと言える命の恩人。幸せだといいな

たった一人あなたと出逢えて、それが俺の唯一の救いであり幸せでした。重たいって思うだろうけどそれだけ心からあなたの幸せを祈ってる

4. Rose modified her skirt so she can fight easily if need (continued.)

Photoshoot today didn't go quite as planned and I'm feeling morose 😤 I've got almost as many cancelled subscriptions as I do current ones and I dunno how to keep my numbers active other than just shovel out content fast...

🧵 ⬇️
The odd quick selfie notwithstanding I do try and put effort into what I produce. My concern is that, if I go ham and pump a bunch of shit out, i'll have an archive of pics and videos I'm not actually proud of at the cost of overworking myself on making porn while still maintaining a full time job
I meant it when I said I value the interest folks who canceled had in my stuff, but it's still a bummer to lose a follower 🤷

When folks tell you that this kind of content is harder than it seems they're telling the truth. It sucks to feel like you're already losing momentum after just starting out
To be clear I don't begrudge anyone for unsubscribing. It's your money, do you what you want with it, and I'm glad I was what you wanted even if it was just for a little bit. I don't expect or franky want to be an overnight sensation anyway, my follower count as it is now still does my head in
You see a lot of folks with dreams of being successful YouTubers really start to hate themselves when they can't make that a viable career. It takes an insane amount of dedication and luck to be successful at that, regardless of your skill level. Porn, while more profitable up front, is very similar
Since i already know from the jump this job is going to be part time I'm less likely to be consumed by self-doubt and hurt feelings, and yet still I get into bummer moods when I don't feel successful or skilled enough 😵‍💫 You can't really avoid it if you're taking what you make seriously
My goal is to improve my skills as a model, supplement my existing income doing so, and create big as a following as I can without steamrolling my mental health. I'll stop when it isn't a fun job anymore. And so far at least I'm still having a great time overall 🧡🖤

Bend could be better at plowing the bike lanes. I also made a post on that. Based on how active they've been with improving the network and listening to feedback, I am confident the demand will increase to the point that they will make that investment though. Cont...
The city is working against decades of car only design and culture so it does take time to get other modes of transportation up to the same standard. Bend is working on creating a sustainable model but more of Oregon needs to take a similar approach.

We also had a ton of bangers in the first round of the 4 team tho. You need to have a few of them be instant classics, and it doesn’t look like this one will have any of those, maybe tonight will or next round, hopefully. Even as a Bama fan I recognize the 2014 playoff was incredible entertainment.

I don’t know how we survived without an expanded playoff. SMU would’ve been one of those ultimate what-if teams.
They should allow the defense more contact on three point shooters, at least up until the shot is released. After the shot is released then protect the shooters landing.
theres definitely something to be said or a team getting super lucky like my team last year (2023 Eagles) but i dont think the 49ers were really better than the Chiefs for example. Also blowing teams out by 35 instead of 17 feels like it gets too much weight.

A psych. hack for reducing DWL in gift giving:

1. Throughout the year, have partner email "gift idea"s  as they arise. 
2. Everyone forgets about the emails / ideas.

the IRS is always portrayed as the ultimate bad guy in movies when really it's just nerds in suits handing you a piece of paper that stresses you out vs. the number of movies that portray cops as heroes or at least helpful while in everyday life they routinely murder people

Oh, it's much older than 40 years. Remember, the USA was one of the countries that invaded Russia shortly after their 1917 revolution. And the Declaration of Independence describes Native Americans as "savages." Our culture comes mostly from the Europeans, who fought each other for 1000s of years.

It's not enough that Trump and his evil sidekick want to make the rich richer and the poor poorer, he wants to cash in on The Almighty himself.
When Putin attacked Ukraine, it did not say, “We are too small and will be trampled, so let’s just try to convince him to be nice to us.” It fought back! And while it might still lose the war (hope not), it demonstrated it will not be pushed around. It showed “guramba”, as Matt Gurney would say. 1/2
Canada now faces its own Putin, or at least one of Putin’s acolytes. No amount of reasoning will work with Trump. We need to fight back. If we lose, we lose, but at least we go down fighting. Because the alternative to fighting back is to lie down and surrender, and that should not be an option. 2/2

サカデのアクションは好きだし、キャラクターもわりと好きだが、作品として微妙だなと思うのが、登場人物に殺し屋をやってる葛藤があまりにも無さすぎるとこ。大っぴらに市街地で暴れまくってるのに、一般人の反応が薄すぎること。そういうギャグでやってんのかと思いきや、殺し屋学校の先生に「この世界は人が簡単に死にすぎる」とか言わせちゃうとこ。

There will be an election in 2025, regardless of what Singh does now, to hold the LPC to account. This performative nonsense is theatre and many NDP supporters are disillusioned, if not disgusted, by Singh's poor judgement. He is out of his mind if he thinks this behaviour helps him or the party.

Last week, the offense helped let the defense down by only managing to possess the ball for twenty minutes. This week, the defense is letting the defense down. They should be more rested because the offense is mostly moving the ball. They’re less than a minute from tying last week’s total TOP.

If i can...I *Might* Be able to lift heavier than 410 if I tried again..if I go over the 410 mark I'd eventually be bench pressing or lifting more than your average body builder..which..I have to be careful with my strength with others 😵‍💫

Why is it NFL kickers *always* aim for the corner when kicking off. When they kick it out of the side of the playing field, it is placed at the 35. It is a STUPID strategy that some statistics guy has promised is brilliant. It is NOT.

Historian Heather Cox Richardson posted a doozy yesterday, 1) On Election Day Trump hung out with members of Germany’s Nazi party 2) “…but to those not paying close attention they were perhaps less striking than the reality that Musk appears to have taken over for Trump as the incoming president.”

Welp. I'm gonna hafta get another speaker now.
Usyk is an amazing fighter, reaffirmed himself as the best of the AJ-Wilder-Fury era as a cruiserweight who moved up. He really doesn't need to do anything else.

Sharks that are alive when caught must be released, others must be landed with fins naturally attached (no finning at sea)

This is spot on. The NFL fixes overpowered play designs by tweaking officiating all the time, the NBA needs to do the same. Make open 3s harder to get by opening up how teams can defend 3s (and run off screens chasing shooters), instantly the shot becomes less valuable.

Also, I don't know if superhero movies are to blame, but *something* about the portrayal of men's bodies in culture clearly changed in the late 2000s/early 2010s, which resulted in a lot of young boys getting their first taste of body dysmorphia, and it was like introducing measles to the Americas.

Reactor - A Short Fairy Tale (1998)

Couldn't find an upload of their third album so onto the 4th. I'd say this was as strong as their first with some thrash influence added in this time so it's not as repetitive. Solid stuff.
This album also might have the first instance of a power metal song about a specific video game. Long before Powerglove or youtube musicians did it. it's a song called Raw Meat and it's about Duke 3D. Even samples Duke's voice lines.

There was a Tau I knew once. He reminded me of an oven hood that hadn't been cleaned for decades--simultaneously greasy and sticky. Any question put to him was ended with a smug and unhelpful answer. I've never read his UFO books, but I can't imagine they're good.

WHY does Trump need the debt ceiling removed or raised if 
Musk's DOGE is going to cut trillions from the budget?

Looks like Trump wants to siphon billions to himself
& strangle prgms that help people (health [NIH, EPA, Medicaid, Medicare] education [Dept of Ed], income support [social security]).

another thing i've been meaning to draw but just continue to not get around to is the first time gwyn sees christmas lights.

liáfsini has natural bioluminescence in both flora and fauna. even if it's not "real", it might be the closest thing she's seen to home in a long time.
i just picture casey driving her somewhere and she sees trees in a park, suddenly just BURSTS out of the car, and blindly runs up to them. casey manages to catch up to her and throws his coat over her because... she's also glowing... and chides her about jumping out of the car like a bonehead.
it'd probably be the first time HE ever sees her walls drop, and how animated and curious she can get. the turtles have def seen it when she's interacted with klunk or other animals they've happened across in various places.
tells her to wait there, goes back to figure out what to do with the car. ...finds a more effective way to hide her hair, make her eyes less visible. walks her through the park. explains things--tells some of his own stories. 

just a nice little moment. u-u more found family bonding.

Speaking of drummers, an underrated one who is sadly no longer with us is Blackie O. from Urge Overkill. 

Give “Saturation” a listen if you haven’t heard it. The drums on that album are incredible — the perfect mixture of loose/tight grooves, and the engineering is top-notch.

So ... News is ... the CONSTITUTION prevents the Mango Menace from taking the "oath of office" because he is an ADJUDICATED INSURRECTIONIST ( as per the Colorado Fed court and Supreme Court). It takes a 2/3s vote in Congress to remove that prohibitional requirement.
He was one hell of a running back. I pray for your ankles trying to square up on that guy.

NEW: Lots of buzz around hydrogen's clean energy potential, but there's a big caveat. The "climate warming effect of hydrogen has been both overlooked and underestimated." If there's a role for hydrogen, we have to get it right from the start. Here's how https://bit.ly/3HNJBYw

#PresidentMusk and #TheInvisibleJDV both support returning Nazis to power in Germany. If that's something they are willing to do openly and publicly, what do you think they're in favor of but keep their mouths shut about? Taking away women's right to vote? Re-instituting slavery? Soylent Green?
We've been hearing about him and others having conversations with foreign leaders during the campaign!  Though it seems our elected officials did not care or wanted to avoid the appearance of harassing him/them!  Why Dems keep letting the other side frame the narrative is beyond belief sometimes!

That’s the second pitch play that doesn’t look like it’s designed to be a pitch. One to Warren, one to Harris.

I had the fight 115-113 in favor of #Usyk. The extra weight #Fury was carrying seemed to help him in the first half of the fight, but definitely seemed to work against him the second half of the fight.

Wonderful from Oleksandr Usyk. Great night's boxing. Best I have seen from Fury for a good while but Usyk's accuracy and combinations were the difference. #usyk

The commentary team have forgotten what scores a point in boxing.  They were loving Fury for standing his ground, not showboating and jabbing well, but missed all the shots Usyk landed by having more ambitious intent. I actually thought it was a close. But 24 rounds & Fury did not hurt Usyk once.

this "person" just followed me too and i'm burning to ask them how they managed to get their eyelid transposed *on top* of the balaklava. is it part of their skin, is that just a new dermis type we have now?

Not sure what's more baffling - the very existence of this show, or the fact this series of repackaged "highlights" is somehow STILL on 10play more than four years after it aired.
Don't get me wrong, I like Chris and Julia and I think they are (were) a fantastic hosting duo.

We have many museums, art, paintings, and they often loan masterpieces from other place, so always find something you like or else would never see in real life.
It’s also a very relaxed city, many parks, old coffee bars, baths, & you’ll find many different cultures here.
